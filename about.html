				<h4>OUR MISSION</h4>
				<p>Our mission at Huddle Up is to make sure our users are satisfied with our website and are able to make time to hang out with there friends without having to worry about if they have plans or a busy schedule that day.
          We want our users to be able to have a good time and with the help of our website it is easy to show you days that you are free to met up and at what time that you are available.</p>
				<br>
				</br>
				<p>The reason we created this webapp is for busy people who can’t find the time to hang out with their friends and family. 
					Our common problem is that we spend all day in school and some of us have jobs, sports, clubs, or other activities to do. 
					So what motivated us to create this webapp is that we know people who face similar problems like us which led us to create Huddle Up, which helps us and you so you can make time for your friends and family without having to worry about your busy schedule. 
					One of the main problems is that we make plans but forget we have others things to do like work or sports that day ,So our webapp creates a day for your and whoever you wanna make plans with that day arrange a good day that you both are free so you won’t have to worry about your busy life schedule. </p>
